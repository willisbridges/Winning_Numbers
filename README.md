# First_Original_Program
 Have you ever wanted to win the lottery? I sure have. Thats why I created this super cool numbers generator for Washington states Powerball lottery.  

Simply download the python file and run it in your command line! Maybe your computer will give you the winning numbers :)

Future ideas:
 I'd like to create a front end for this and deploy it through heroku or something so it will be easier to use for non-technical folks
 It would also be cool to somehow make it usable for all different kinds of lotteries?
